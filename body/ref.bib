    abstract = {The interest in exploring planetary bodies for scientific investigation and in situ resource utilization is ever-rising. Yet, many sites of interest are inaccessible to state-of-the-art planetary exploration robots because of the robots’ inability to traverse steep slopes, unstructured terrain, and loose soil. In addition, current single-robot approaches only allow a limited exploration speed and a single set of skills. Here, we present a team of legged robots with complementary skills for exploration missions in challenging planetary analog environments. We equipped the robots with an efficient locomotion controller, a mapping pipeline for online and postmission visualization, instance segmentation to highlight scientific targets, and scientific instruments for remote and in situ investigation. Furthermore, we integrated a robotic arm on one of the robots to enable high-precision measurements. Legged robots can swiftly navigate representative terrains, such as granular slopes beyond 25°, loose soil, and unstructured terrain, highlighting their advantages compared with wheeled rover systems. We successfully verified the approach in analog deployments at the Beyond Gravity ExoMars rover test bed, in a quarry in Switzerland, and at the Space Resources Challenge in Luxembourg. Our results show that a team of legged robots with advanced locomotion, perception, and measurement skills, as well as task-level autonomy, can conduct successful, effective missions in a short time. Our approach enables the scientific exploration of planetary target sites that are currently out of human and robotic reach. A team of legged robots with task-level autonomy was designed and field-tested for planetary analog exploration.}

    abstract = {Coordinating the motion between lower and upper limbs and aligning limb control with perception are substantial challenges in robotics, particularly in dynamic environments. To this end, we introduce an approach for enabling legged mobile manipulators to play badminton, a task that requires precise coordination of perception, locomotion, and arm swinging. We propose a unified reinforcement learning–based control policy for whole-body visuomotor skills involving all degrees of freedom to achieve effective shuttlecock tracking and striking. This policy is informed by a perception noise model that uses real-world camera data, allowing for consistent perception error levels between simulation and deployment and encouraging learned active perception behaviors. Our method includes a shuttlecock prediction model and constrained reinforcement learning for robust motion control to enhance deployment readiness. Extensive experimental results in a variety of environments validate the robot’s capability to predict shuttlecock trajectories, navigate the service area effectively, and execute precise strikes against human players, demonstrating the feasibility of using legged mobile manipulators in complex and dynamic sports scenarios. A legged mobile manipulator trained to play badminton with humans coordinates whole-body maneuvers and onboard perception.}

    abstract = {ABSTRACT Quadrupedal robots are highly regarded for their superior locomotion capabilities and terrain adaptability, making them competent in a wide range of applications. For autonomous navigation, they must track upper-level trajectories to reach designated locations with flexible obstacle avoidance. This is typically achieved by a planner, which generates a reference velocity, and a controller, which accurately tracks the velocity commands. This article proposes a learning-based controller for quadrupedal robots that is trained in simulation and achieves accurate and robust velocity tracking in the real world. To bridge the gap betwen simulation and reality, an analytical actuator model is introduced to simulation to simulate physical actuator dynamics. We then train a control policy in simulation using Constrained Reinforcement Learning, where symmetry and smoothness constraints are incorporated into Reinforcement Learning. The symmetry constraint promotes coordinated locomotion and consistent velocity tracking performance, while the smoothness constraint reduces jerky actions and generates stable velocity performance. The proposed control policy is zero-shot deployed on the Unitree AlienGo. Experimental results demonstrate a velocity tracking error below 0.084 m/s across the entire operational velocity range while maintaining robust locomotion on natural terrains. To further validate the controller's effectiveness, we integrate it into a pedestrian tracking framework, where it demonstrates precise trajectory following capabilities and long-term reliability.}
